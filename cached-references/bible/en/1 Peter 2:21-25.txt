 21 For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered for us,[a] leaving us[b] an example, that you should follow His steps:22 “Who committed no sin,Nor was deceit found in His mouth”; [c]23 who, when He was reviled, did not revile in return; when He suffered, He did not threaten, but committed Himself to Him who judges righteously;  24 who Himself bore our sins in His own body on the tree, that we, having died to sins, might live for righteousness—by whose stripes you were healed.  25 For you were like sheep going astray, but have now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer[d] of your souls.
