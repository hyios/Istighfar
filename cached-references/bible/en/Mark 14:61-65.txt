And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven.”63 Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, “What further need do we have of witnesses?  64 You have heard the blasphemy! What do you think?”And they all condemned Him to be deserving of death.65 Then some began to spit on Him, and to blindfold Him, and to beat Him, and to say to Him, “Prophesy!” And the officers struck Him with the palms of their hands.[a]
