76 “And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Highest;For you will go before the face of the Lord to prepare His ways,77 To give knowledge of salvation to His peopleBy the remission of their sins,78 Through the tender mercy of our God,With which the Dayspring from on high has visited[a] us;79 To give light to those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death,To guide our feet into the way of peace.”
