 32 This Jesus God has raised up, of which we are all witnesses.  33 Therefore being exalted to the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, He poured out this which you now see and hear.34 “For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he says himself:‘The Lord said to my Lord,“Sit at My right hand,35 Till I make Your enemies Your footstool.”’[a]36 “Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.”
